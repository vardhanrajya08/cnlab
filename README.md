# Learn Network Protocol and Programming Using **C**

## Prerequisite

* Basics of computer networks
* Intermediate in C language

## Purpose

The Purpose of learning this course is to understand the various network layer, transport layer and application layer protocols and it also helps to design and implement the protocols using socking programming.

### List Of Experiment

1. Study of necessary header files with respect to socket programming.
2. Study of Basic Functions of Socket Programming.
3. Simple TCP/IP Client Server Communication.
4. UDP Echo Client Server Communication.
5. Concurrent TCP/IP Day-Time Server.
6. Half Duplex Chat Using TCP/IP.
7. Full Duplex Chat Using TCP/IP.
8. Implementation of File Transfer Protocol.
9. Remote Command Execution Using UDP.
10. Arp Implementation Using UDP.

### Tips for using the repository

* Use ```make``` . Example : ```make fileName``` (without extention C)
* It will make server and client file for you.
* Test using ```./server``` in a terminal separately and ```./client``` in a different terminal.
